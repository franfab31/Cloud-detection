# cloud-detection
This repository contains the code of my thesis project, which focuses on detecting clouds in satellite images from the 38-Cloud dataset using a U-Net deep learning model. The project involves data preprocessing, training, and evaluation of the model, with an emphasis on cloud segmentation accuracy. It also includes an analysis of challenges such as class imbalance and the difficulty of distinguishing clouds from snow and water surfaces. Performance metrics like F1-score and Accuracy are used to assess the model's effectiveness.

In this repository, you'll find two versions of the code: one without visible images and another with images included for better visualization. The full version of the project, including all tested models, results, and performance graphs, can be accessed through a linked external resource: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o_vXwKJ-tUSLlE0lBFoPvBSHhS6VXaaC?usp=sharing
